Hands Lie Detector

Scoring Rubric (v0.1 — “Stop Calling Everyone Office Workers”)

Goal:
Estimate Experience Probability based on persistent physical markers, not vibes, props, or cleanliness.

Score each category. Total = 100 points.

⸻

1. Texture Persistence (0–25 pts)

Does the skin retain evidence after washing?

	•	0–5: Smooth, uniform, cosmetic-grade
	•	6–15: Mild texture, mostly even
	•	16–25: Deep creases, thickened zones, uneven elasticity

Key insight:
Soap removes dirt. It does not reset skin architecture.

⸻

2. Wear Localization (0–20 pts)

Is wear specific or generalized?

	•	0–5: No wear or fully uniform
	•	6–12: Some thickening, poorly localized
	•	13–20: Task-specific calluses (finger bases, thumb pad, heel of palm)

Red flag:
“Rough everywhere” = aesthetic roughness, not labor.

⸻

3. Micro-Injury History (0–15 pts)

Evidence of healed damage, not current mess.

	•	0–5: None visible
	•	6–10: Few, shallow, recent-only
	•	11–15: Multiple healed cuts/scars at varied stages

Important:
Competent workers heal injuries repeatedly.
Cosplayers accumulate one dramatic wound and tell stories about it forever.

⸻

4. Tendon & Vein Definition (0–15 pts)

Does the hand show long-term load adaptation?

	•	0–5: Soft, low definition
	•	6–10: Moderate definition
	•	11–15: Clear tendon paths, vascular prominence

Note:
This is usage over time, not fitness flexing.

⸻

5. Nail Evidence (0–10 pts)

Nails as tools vs nails as decorations.

	•	0–3: Manicured, uniform, pristine
	•	4–7: Short, uneven wear
	•	8–10: Minor damage, staining, functional trimming

Tell:
The thumbnail always snitches.

⸻

6. Symmetry of Wear (0–10 pts)

One hand working, or both?

	•	0–3: Dominant hand only
	•	4–7: Partial symmetry
	•	8–10: Clear bilateral adaptation

Implication:
Two-handed work = real work.

⸻

Interpretation Bands
	•	0–30: Podcast Hands
	•	31–55: Dirty but Unused / Casual Hobbyist
	•	56–75: Working Hands (Light–Moderate)
	•	76–90: Experienced Trade / Field Work
	•	91–100: “Don’t Ask, Just Hand Them the Tool”
