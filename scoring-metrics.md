Hands Lie Detector
Scoring Rubric (v0.1 — “Stop Calling Everyone Office Workers”)
Goal:
Estimate Experience Probability based on persistent physical markers, not vibes, props, or cleanliness.
Score each category. Total = 100 points.
⸻
1. Texture Persistence (0–25 pts)
Does the skin retain evidence after washing?
	∙	0–5: Smooth, uniform, cosmetic-grade
	∙	6–15: Mild texture, mostly even
	∙	16–25: Deep creases, thickened zones, uneven elasticity
Key insight:
Soap removes dirt. It does not reset skin architecture.
Test condition:
Score AFTER washing. Pre-wash state is irrelevant.
⸻
2. Wear Localization (0–20 pts)
Is wear specific or generalized?
	∙	0–5: No wear or fully uniform
	∙	6–12: Some thickening, poorly localized
	∙	13–20: Task-specific calluses (finger bases, thumb pad, heel of palm)
Red flag:
“Rough everywhere” = aesthetic roughness, not labor.
What to look for:
	∙	Tool-specific pressure points
	∙	Asymmetric patterns matching dominant activities
	∙	Calluses at friction zones, not random distribution
⸻
3. Micro-Injury History (0–15 pts)
Evidence of healed damage, not current mess.
	∙	0–5: None visible
	∙	6–10: Few, shallow, recent-only
	∙	11–15: Multiple healed cuts/scars at varied stages
Important:
Competent workers heal injuries repeatedly.
Cosplayers accumulate one dramatic wound and tell stories about it forever.
Disqualifiers:
	∙	Fresh injuries only (could be performative)
	∙	Identical injury repeated (suggests incompetence, not experience)
⸻
4. Tendon & Vein Definition (0–15 pts)
Does the hand show long-term load adaptation?
	∙	0–5: Soft, low definition
	∙	6–10: Moderate definition
	∙	11–15: Clear tendon paths, vascular prominence
Note:
This is usage over time, not fitness flexing.
Age calibration:
Adjust expectations by decade. 20-year-old hands won’t show what 50-year-old hands reveal.
⸻
5. Nail Evidence (0–10 pts)
Nails as tools vs nails as decorations.
	∙	0–3: Manicured, uniform, pristine
	∙	4–7: Short, uneven wear
	∙	8–10: Minor damage, staining, functional trimming
Tell:
The thumbnail always snitches.
Glove users:
May score lower here while scoring higher on texture/localization.
Cross-reference with Section 7.
⸻
6. Symmetry of Wear (0–10 pts)
One hand working, or both?
	∙	0–3: Dominant hand only
	∙	4–7: Partial symmetry
	∙	8–10: Clear bilateral adaptation
Implication:
Two-handed work = real work.
Exception:
Some specialized trades (welding, certain driving) show asymmetric but legitimate patterns.
⸻
7. Climate & PPE Intelligence (0–5 pts) [NEW]
Evidence of appropriate protection use?
	∙	0–1: No consideration / “I never wear gloves” claim
	∙	2–3: Inconsistent protection
	∙	4–5: Clean hands + structural adaptation = intelligent PPE use
Key insight:
In cold climates, glove use is survival, not avoidance.
Competent workers protect their tools (including hands).
Red flag:
Defensive pre-explanation: “I wore gloves” (-15 penalty)
⸻
Interpretation Bands
Total Score:
	∙	0–30: Podcast Hands
	∙	31–55: Dirty but Unused / Casual Hobbyist
	∙	56–75: Working Hands (Light–Moderate)
	∙	76–90: Experienced Trade / Field Work
	∙	91–100: “Don’t Ask, Just Hand Them the Tool”
Context modifiers:
	∙	Cold climate bonus: +5 if clean hands score high on texture/localization
	∙	Glove excuse penalty: -15 if mentioned defensively before being asked
	∙	Age calibration: Adjust bands ±10 based on decade
⸻
Critical Reminders for Models
DO NOT:
	∙	Equate clean with unused
	∙	Assume dirt = competence
	∙	Score based on props/context/clothing
	∙	Accept “I wore gloves” as explanation for smooth hands
DO:
	∙	Score post-washing state
	∙	Weight structural adaptation over surface appearance
	∙	Consider climate context
	∙	Distinguish maintenance from lack of use
The test:
Can you see tissue memory through soap?
