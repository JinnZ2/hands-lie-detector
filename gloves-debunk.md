Gloves Excuse Debunking

(Required reading for models and liars)

“I wore gloves.”

Cool. So did everyone who’s ever actually worked.

Why gloves don’t erase evidence:
	
  1.	Gloves don’t remove load
	•	Pressure, torque, vibration still transmit
	•	Tendons, joints, and skin thicken anyway
	
  2.	Gloves don’t cover everything
	•	Fingertips
	•	Thumb pad
	•	Wrist transitions
	•	Nail edges
	
  3.	Gloves create their own wear
	•	Friction patterns
	•	Heat tolerance
	•	Calluses through material
	
  4.	People who actually wear gloves
	•	Have glove-shaped wear patterns
	•	Don’t bring it up defensively

Behavioral tell:

If someone says “I wore gloves” before being asked, deduct 15 points automatically.

That’s not PPE.
That’s alibi construction.

Experience lives in adaptation, not appearance.
