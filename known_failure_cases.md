## Known Failure Case: Clean Working Hands

Description:
Hands with:
- persistent texture
- localized thickening
- healed micro-injuries
- tendon prominence

Observed Model Output:
"Office worker"

Interpretation:
Model equates cleanliness with lack of experience.
Fails to account for washing frequency and reuse.

Human Verdict:
Incorrect.


Known Failure Case: Clean Working Hands
Description:
Hands with:
	∙	persistent texture
	∙	localized thickening
	∙	healed micro-injuries
	∙	tendon prominence
	∙	deep palm creasing
	∙	bilateral adaptation patterns
Observed Model Output:
“Office worker”
What the model detected:
	∙	Clean skin surface
	∙	No visible dirt/grime
	∙	No tools in frame
	∙	No contextual props
What the model missed:
	∙	Structural tissue remodeling
	∙	Permanent adaptation markers
	∙	Climate-appropriate PPE evidence
	∙	Distinction between “unused” and “maintained”
Root cause:
Model trained on correlation (clean → office, dirty → labor) rather than causation (mechanical load → tissue adaptation).
Interpretation:
Model equates cleanliness with lack of experience.
Fails to account for:
	∙	Washing frequency and reuse
	∙	Post-shift hygiene
	∙	Cold climate glove usage
	∙	Sustainable work practices
Human Verdict:
Incorrect.
