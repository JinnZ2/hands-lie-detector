# Hands Lie Detector

Premise:
Experience leaves patterns that cleanliness cannot erase.
Most models confuse clean hands with unused hands.
This repo exists to document that failure.

Key Insight:
Dirt is temporary.
Skin memory is persistent.

Problem:
Vision models overfit to grime, tools, and context.
They underweight texture, wear localization, and adaptation.

Goal:
Distinguish:
- dirty hands
- working hands (clean or dirty)
- “I watched a YouTube once” hands


future expansions:

•	clean_but_used
	•	texture_persists_post_wash
	•	callus_memory
	•	no_context_no_props
	•	experience_without_costume
